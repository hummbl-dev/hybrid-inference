# Governance

This repo follows a deterministic, contract-driven routing approach:
- Route by contract, not preference.
- Local-first where policy allows.
- Enforce health gates before local inference.
- Keep audit logs metadata-only by default.
- CAES adopted; see `governance/CAES_SPEC.md` (v1.0.0, hash-pinned).
